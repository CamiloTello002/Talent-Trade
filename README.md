Talent Trade is a platform for exchanging knowledge and skills between people. It connects those who want to learn something new with those willing to share their expertise. Users can create detailed profiles with contact information, photo, specialty, and a brief personal description, facilitating connections between people with complementary interests.

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>There are existing applications that allow you to connect with people for some specific purpose. Take <a href="https://tandem.net/es" target="_blank">Tandem</a> as an example for language exchange or <a href="https://www.couchsurfing.com/">Couchsurfing</a> for connecting travelers with hosts.</p>
<p>Our application aims to pair up people from a <b>wide</b> gamut of fields and specialties and allow for interaction between them so that they can <strong>exchange</strong> their knowledge and, additionally, see the chance of building a connection.</p>
<p>We make sure you're paired up with the right person by making sure your interests and specialties match with the other individual's interests and specialties.</p>

<h3>Use case example</h3>
Catriel knows HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but he wants to improve his English. Owen is a native English speaker who wants to learn web development. They both hear about Talent Trade, give it a try and meet on that platform. Given that their specialties and interests match, they arrange a session to exchange knowledge, benefiting each other.
